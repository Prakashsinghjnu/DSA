461. Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1
Solutions :


class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int k=(x^y);
        int c=0;
        while(k!=0){
            if((k&1)==1){
                c++;
            }
            k=k>>1;
        }
        return c;

    }
