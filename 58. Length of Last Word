58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

SOLUTION ::

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int n = s.length() - 1;

        // if (s.length() == 1 && s.charAt(0) != ' ') {
        //     return 1;
        // }
        while (n >= 0 && s.charAt(n) == ' ') {
            n--;
        }

        int count = 0;

        while (n >= 0 && s.charAt(n) != ' ') {
            count++;
            n--;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
