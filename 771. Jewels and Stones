771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

SOLUTION  ::


class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0;i<stones.length();i++){
            char ch =stones.charAt(i);
            map.put(ch,map.getOrDefault(ch,0)+1);
        }
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.length();i++){
            char ch= jewels.charAt(i);
           if(map.containsKey(ch)){
               result +=map.get(ch);
           }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
